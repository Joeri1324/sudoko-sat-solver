# sudoko-sat-solverhttp://blog.forret.com/2006/08/14/a-sudoku-challenge-generator/
Soduko problem instances are transformed to sat instances and subsequently solved.

# Research Question:
 Posibillities:
 - Is the relative amount of givens a valid predictor for the computational hardness of a sudoko puzzle.
 - Is the distribution of amount of givens a valid predictor for the computational hardness of a sudoku puzzle.

## To do
- Check statistics of picosat
- experiment: givens vs. computational difficulty.
- plot the results.
- expirement: probabillity of properness vs. amount of givens.
- plot the results.
- write it down in report.
