# sudoko-sat-solver
Soduko problem instances are transformed to sat instances and subsequently solved.

# Research Question:
 Posibillities:
 - Is the relative amount of givens a valid predictor for the computational hardness of a sudoko puzzle.
 - Is the distribution of amount of givens a valid predictor for the computational hardness of a sudoku puzzle.

## To do
- Encode sudoku into sat
- Implement sat solver (https://github.com/ContinuumIO/pycosat) check if there is a paper.
